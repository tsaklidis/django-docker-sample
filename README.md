# Django Docker Sample Project

This project demonstrates how to set up and run a simple Django application using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can find instructions for installing Docker and Docker Compose on the following pages:

* [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
* [Docker Compose installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to build the Docker images and start the Django application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d


4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Django startup page.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:


docker-compose.yml
project/
  Dockerfile
  manage.py
  ...


The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services for the Django application. The `Dockerfile` file defines the Docker image for the Django application. The `manage.py` file is the Django management command script. The `project` directory contains the Django project files.

## Usage

Once the Django application is running, you can use the following commands to manage the application:

* `docker-compose run web django-admin startproject myproject` - Creates a new Django project named `myproject`.
* `docker-compose run web django-admin startproject --template mytemplate.zip` - Creates a new Django project named `myproject` using the template specified by `mytemplate.zip`.
* `docker-compose run web django-admin runserver` - Starts the Django development server.
* `docker-compose run web collectstatic` - Collects all static files for the Django application.
* `docker-compose run web makemigrations` - Creates migrations for the Django application.
* `docker-compose run web migrate` - Applies migrations to the Django database.
* `docker-compose stop` - Stops the Django application.
* `docker-compose down` - Stops and removes the Django application containers and volumes.

## Development

To develop the Django application, you can make changes to the project files and then rebuild the Docker image and restart the application using the following command:

bash
docker-compose up -d


## Deployment

To deploy the Django application to a production environment, you can build the Docker image and push it to a Docker registry. Then, you can deploy the Docker image to a production server using a deployment tool such as Kubernetes or Ansible.

## Additional Notes

* This project uses PostgreSQL as the database for the Django application. You can change the database to a different type by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* This project uses Gunicorn as the WSGI server for the Django application. You can change the WSGI server to a different type by editing the `Dockerfile` file.
